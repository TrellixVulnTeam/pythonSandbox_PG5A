  py -3 -m venv [folderName]
    Creates Virtual Environment
    -3 is version of python
    -m is module you want to install
      venv virtual Environment
    [folderName is the name of the folder you want to create]

  requirements.txt
    a list of dependencies application will need to function properly
      (similar to package.json)
    pip install -r requirements.txt
      installs all the dependencies. (similar to npm install command)

  # are comments
  '''
  These are doc strings
  '''

  print("something")
    prints to console.

  type()
    gets the data type of whatever you pass into the method

    NoneType is none (absence of value)

  help()
    returns documentation on whats in the parameter

  dir()
    returns a list of methods that can be used with datatypes/variables w/e
    help(set().add)

Strings are immutable
  you can't use indexing to change individual elements of a string
  String objects do not support item assignment.
  Dont support item assignment.

  Immutability is when you cannot change the object itself when manipulating it.
    You would have to create another object with the changes.

  # are comments

  a = "string"

  a[::-1]
    reverses the string
    "gnirts"

  a[1:]
    after first char to end of the world
    #tring

  # String multiplication
  letter = 'z'

  letter * 10
    # 'zzzzzzzzzz'

  #string formatting
  .format()
  f-strings

  n = "Yael"
  print('Hello, my name is {}'.format(n))

  # Hello, my name is Yael


  # formatting floating point numbers
  # float formatting follows "{value:width.precision f}"
  # width is the whitespace
  #   https://pyformat.info/

  result = 100/777
  print(result)
  print("The result was {r:1.3f}".format(r=result))
    0.1287001287001287
    The result was 0.129

  # f strings
  print(f'Hello, his name is {n}')



Lists (arrays in python)
  support indexing and
  lists are mutable
  supports multidemensional arrays
  can have multiple object types

  # can concatenate lists

  l1 = ['one', 'two', 'three']
  l2 = ['four', 'five', 'six']
  l1 + l2

  ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six']

  # add to end of list. Similar to .push in js
  l1.append('addition')

  # pop, removes items from the end of the list and returns that object
  # by default index location is -1
  l1.pop()
  popped_item = l1.pop()
  popped_item

  # sorting is done by .sort() (like js)
  # does not return a list, just sorts it in the current lists

  # reversing is done by .reverse() (like js)
  # does not return a list



Dictionaries
  Are objects retrieved by key name
    (lists are retrieved by index position)
  Are mutable like Lists
  Unordered and cannot be sorted
  Formatting is similar to json
  Can support multidemensional dictionaries

  ordereddict object can support sorting in dictionaries.

  # calling items in dict
  newDict = {"a": 1, "b": 2}

  newDict["a"]
    1



Tuples
  Similar to lists but are immutable.
    Once element inside of a tuple it, cannot be reassigned.
    tuple object does not support item assignment
  uses parenthesis
  You won't use tuples often
    You use tuples for when you pass around objects in your program that you don't want to get accidentally changed.
    Data integrity
  Does not have a lot of methods for tuples


  t[0]
    calls first value of tuple. Similar to list/(arrays in js)
  t.count('val')
    counts how many times 'val' appears in tuple.



Sets
  unorder collections of unique elements
  similar to arrayLists in Java.
  does not contain duplicate elements
  Union and Intersection
    Union - combination of two sets
      designated by the union symbol 'U'
      .union()
    Intersection - values that are similar in both sides of the union
      designated by upside down union symbol (upside down u)
      .intersection()


Booleans
  first letter of True or False has to be capitalize



FileIO
  %%write myfile.txt
    writes a text file with jupyter notebook

  open('[path]')
    opens file
    (does not work with extension, use python filename.py command)
    provide full file path to open a file somewhere else on your system.
  open('[path]',mode='val')
    mode='r' - read only
    mode='w' - write only
    mode='a' - append only
    mode='r+' - reading and writing
    mode='w+' - writing and reading (overwrites exisiting files or creates a new file)

  f.ready()
    Returns output of the file.
  f.seek(0)
    resets the read cursor to beginning of the file
  f.readlines()
    creates a list with each line on the list.

  f.close()
    closes file so you don't get errors elsewhere in your operating system.

  f.write()
    writes to the file
    cursor is at the end of the document

  with
    with keyword is like define? but does not define a method?



Comparison operatiors
  Same as javascript except with out ===
  == is the same as js ===



Logical operatiors
  and keyword instead of &&
  or keyword instead of ||
  not keyword negates the comparison operator
    (not 1 == 1) is equal to (1 != 1)

Control flow
  if, Elif and Else

  if some_condition:
    # execute some code
  elif some_other_condition:
    # execute some code
  else:
    # do something else

  For loops are similar to map function in js and forEach in Java
  for var in List:
    # do something

  Common to use _ for forloop if don't plan on using the variable within the loop.
  for _ in myL:
    print("Cool!")
  can iterate over tuples as well.

  Tuple unpacking - duplicate the structure in the list and you do something with them.
  Can iterate thru a dictionary as well.
  obj = {'k1': 1, 'k2': 2, 'k3': 3}

  for val in obj.values():
    print(val)

  for k in obj.keys():
    print(k)

  while some_boolean_condition:
    # do something
  else:
    # do something else

  Kernel > interrupt / restart
    If jupyter notebook gets into endless loop

  break - breaks out of the current closest enclosing loop
    similar to break to javascript
    exits the loop
  continue - goes to the top of the closest enclosing loop
    similar to continue in javascript
    skips the iteration and continues the loop
  pass - does nothing at all
    pass is used for prevent eof (end of file) errors.
    Can write a for loop and not add any code to execute (to come back later)

  Special Operatorss
    range([start], [stop], [step-size])
      used in a for loop prints the range of from start to stop.
        Can change the increment value with step size. (can go up by 2, 3 or 4) default is 1.

      for num in range(0,11,2):
        print(num)

      list(range(0,11,2)) # casting numbers to a list.

      Range is a generator
        Generator is a special type of function that will generate information instead of save it all to memory

    enumerate(str)
      Return index count along with value when used in for loop in a tuple
      list(enumerate(str)) # casting tuples to a list

    zip(list1, list2)
      combines to lists for iteration
      if you run zip a lone, it returns the generated zip's memory address
      returns list a list of tuples

      will only display as far back as the list that is the shortest
        list 1 = 5 items
        list 2 = 3 items
        zip will print out 3 items.

      list(zip(list1, list2)) # can be casted to a list

    in [keyword operator]
      similar to indexOf in js. Except that it returns a boolean like .contains in javascript
      used a lot when working with strings

    min(list)
      shows minimum value in a list

    max(list)
      shows maximum value in a list

    shuffle(list)
      from random [package] import shuffle
      randomizes items in a list.
      does not return anything

    randint(min, max)
      returns a random number with min and max.
      similar to javascript Math.Random()

    input('str')
      Accepts input from user
      accepts everything as a string.
      Can be wrapped for casting.



List Comprehensions
  flattened for loops
    celcius = [0,10,20,34.5]
    fahrenheit = [((9/5) * temp + 32) for temp in celcius]
    append is implied in flattened for loops

    if else statements are reverse order
    results = [x if x % 2 == 0 else 'ODD' for x in range(0,11)]

    can do nested loops
    results = [x*y for x in [2,4,6,] for y in [1,10,1000]]

    Always try to do readability first.



Methods
  def name_of_function():
    print("some code")

  How to document methods
    '''
    DOCSTRING: Information about the function
    INPUT: no input...
    OUTPUT: Hello
    '''

  positional arguments - the name given to arguments of a method where the first item will be first variable in method. Second argument is the second variable etc. Based off of position they are in the parameters of the method.

  def func(a,b,c=0,d=0,e=0):

  *args - arguments
    Allows you take a arbitrary number of arguments
    Arguments will be treated as a tuple inside of the function
    def func(*args):

  **kwargs - keyword arguments
    arbitrary number of keyword arguments
    treats it as a dictionary as a input.
    def func(**kwargs):
    func(a=1, b=2):

  args and kwargs can be used in combination
    Useful to be used outside of arguments
    func(*args, **kwargs):
    func(1,2,3,4,5,6,a=1,b=2,c=3)

  Lambda Expressions - Anonymous function - Map and Filter
    Way to create anonymous functions that are used only once.

    map - map(func, iter) - used to replace the for loop, with less code. Allows you to run a method on each item in the iter.
      can cast into list, by wrapping list() around it.

    filter - returns a iterable when the items passed in the function are True.

    reduce -
      no longer built-in function
      demoted to functtools module
      "Use functools.reduce() if you really need it; however 99% of the time an explicit for loop is more readable."
        Guido Van Rossum, Python Creator


    lambda - keyword creates anonymous function.
      lambda num: num ** 2
      can write python in one line, but not standard in styling (but looks cool)
      Should only use it when you can easily read it if you were to come back to your code later.

  Nested Statements and Scope
    create a variable in python, the variable is stored in a namespace.
      namespace also has a scope (similar to javascript)

    LEGB - Local Enclosing, Global (module), Built-in
      Order that python is going to look for variables in

    global - keyword used within another scope can change the global variable value
      Not recommended.
