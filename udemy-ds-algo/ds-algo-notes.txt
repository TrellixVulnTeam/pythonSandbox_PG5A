Recursion
    calling application multiple times
    base condition is needed to stop recursion

    prominent usage in trees and graphs

    used in many algorithms
        div and conquier
        greedy
        dynamic programming

    iteration is more space and time efficient

    step 1: recursive case - the flow
    step 2: base case - the stopping criterion
    step 3: unintentional case - the constraint
